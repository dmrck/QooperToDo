Mobile Developer Technical
Challenge

I've completed the to-do app that this challenge requires. It has been both a good practice and an enjoyable work for me.

This project is an mobile application where you can simply log in with your username and name and save, edit and delete what to do.

If you are opening for the first time or have logged out before, you will be greeted with a login.

If you have successfully logged in, you can now create what to do.
